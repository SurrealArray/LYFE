# LYFE

Built in 2017 when first learning programming and the C language for a college course project. Project is only one file since I didn't know how to use seperate files for one program at the time. 

Built and ran using Mac OS, but may work using Windows. 

Program consists of only inputting numbers and no letters or special characters are valid inputs. Has error checking just in case.
